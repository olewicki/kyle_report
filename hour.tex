\section{Number of pushes/builds BY HOUR OF THE DAY}

More pushes and builds during the night for the try and mozilla-inbound branches then during the day. 

Regarding the mozilla-central and mozilla-release branches, the number of pushes is stable over the hours of the day, but for midnight where there is a down-peak. The number of builds goes down during the morning and there is a peak in both branches at 1 pm.

\kyle{Could you explain these behaviors?}
