\section{Number of pushes/builds BY DAY OF THE WEEK}

For all the branches, the numbers go down during the night, stable during the day. 

\kyle{Last Skype meeting, you explained the stability during the day by the resource limitation. No more resource is available, that is why the numbers do not increase further up. Can you confirm?}
